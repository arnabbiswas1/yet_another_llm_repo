Following report is entirely generated by the Code Interpreter Plugin available through ChatGPT-Plus.

- Dataset used: [Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabbiswas1/microsoft-azure-predictive-maintenance)
- Chat Interations to explor the data: [Data Exploration](https://chat.openai.com/share/fca66ade-cf07-415b-a729-6d5eaf10323b)

At the end of the exploration I asked the plugin to create a zip file consisting of all the visulaizations and a markdown file describing the data, so that I can present it to my customer. And here it is.
